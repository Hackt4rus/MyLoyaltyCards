# MyLoyaltyCards
Author: Carmelo Ballone, Date: 08/2021

This Android app allows user to store companies loyalty cards. The user can insert the company's name and his client code, then select the client code format between Bar code or QR code, to display it on the back side of the card. The user can also select the background color of the card by picking it from a pop up shown by clicking the appropriate button, and optionally select the company's logo. The main view lists all the cards stored and the details (front and back) of a single card are shown by clicking on it. A long press on a single card opens a pop up asking to delete the card and this operation can be undone in 10 seconds. Data persistence is not implemented.
